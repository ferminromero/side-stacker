### Side Stacker Game

This repo contains a server and client for a two-player browser game in real-time.

The server uses node.js and can be found in app.js

The client uses React.js and can be found in the folder side-stacker-client


## Game Rules
This is essentially connect-four, but the pieces stack on either side of the board instead of bottom-up.

Two players see a board, which is a grid of 7 rows and 7 columns. They take turn adding pieces to a row, on one of the sides. The pieces stack on top of each other, and the game ends when there are no spaces left available, or when a player has four consecutive pieces on a diagonal, column, or row.

For example, the board might look like this:

0 [ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]

1 [ o x _ _ _ _ o ]

2 [ x _ _ _ _ _ x ]

3 [ x _ _ _ _ _ o ]

4 [ o _ _ _ _ _ _ ]

5 [ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]

6 [ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]

in this case, it is xâ€™s turn. If x plays (2, R), the board will look like this:

0 [ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]

1 [ o x _ _ _ _ o ]

2 [ x _ _ _ _ x x ]

3 [ x _ _ _ _ _ o ]

4 [ o _ _ _ _ _ _ ]

5 [ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]

6 [ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]
